# [snappy] bindings for [Chicken Scheme]

This is more of a personal backup than anything else. It should
probably be rewritten to use the Snappy C++ API which should support
streaming, or embed something like
[snappy-c](https://github.com/andikleen/snappy-c).

## Requirements

- [snappy] version ?

## Source Code

Hosted [here](https://github.com/kristianlm/chicken-snappy).

## APi

See sources and tests.
